  <p class="content">Welcome to my world!</p>

  <br>

  <p class="content">I am currently pursuing Master’s in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, a research orientated graduate program, involves supervised research for the entire program duration. My research is at the intersection of computer vision/AI and Psychology. Trying to understand human body language in a groups of people based on the facial expressions, facial movements and body pose. I am exploring how things like gender, age, if someone is depressed or in state of conflict affects body language.</p>

  <p class="content">Prior to joining CMU, I worked as a research staff at School Of Computer Science & Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Where I was working in the area of embedded computer vision, on implementing real time, hardware efficient pedestrian detection on FPGA’s. Prior to that during my undergrad I did a double major in Physics and Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani University, India. </p>
